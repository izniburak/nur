> Nur Framework has been created for just fun and adapted by using some most popular parts of the popular PHP Frameworks like Laravel and Symfony. 
> It has a simple but powerful infrastructure. It contains a lot of component in order to prepare web applications.
> So, It can be a preference for your small (maybe medium) projects. If you say "I'll make a bigger project.", I suggest you use a full-stack framework. :) e.g: Laravel, Symfony...
